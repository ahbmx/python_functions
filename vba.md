Here's a VBA solution that will create a text file when you click on an ID cell, or open it in Notepad if it already exists:

```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim selectedID As String
    Dim filePath As String
    Dim folderPath As String
    Dim fullPath As String
    
    ' Set your specific folder path here
    folderPath = "C:\YourFolderPath\" ' Change this to your desired folder
    
    ' Check if only one cell is selected and it's in column with IDs
    If Target.CountLarge > 1 Then Exit Sub
    
    ' Check if the selected cell is in the ID column (assuming column A)
    If Target.Column = 1 And Target.Row >= 1 Then
        selectedID = Target.Value
        
        ' Validate that it's an ID (starts with "ID" followed by numbers)
        If Left(selectedID, 2) = "ID" And IsNumeric(Mid(selectedID, 3)) Then
            ' Create full file path
            fullPath = folderPath & selectedID & ".txt"
            
            ' Check if file exists
            If Dir(fullPath) <> "" Then
                ' File exists - open in Notepad
                Shell "notepad.exe " & Chr(34) & fullPath & Chr(34), vbNormalFocus
            Else
                ' File doesn't exist - create it
                CreateTextFile fullPath
                MsgBox "File created: " & fullPath, vbInformation
            End If
        End If
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub CreateTextFile(filePath As String)
    Dim fileNumber As Integer
    
    ' Get next available file number
    fileNumber = FreeFile
    
    ' Create and immediately close the file
    Open filePath For Output As fileNumber
    Close fileNumber
End Sub
```

## How to use this code:

1. **Press Alt+F11** to open the VBA editor
2. **Double-click** on the worksheet where your ID column is located
3. **Paste** the code above into the code window
4. **Modify the folder path** in the code:
   ```vba
   folderPath = "C:\YourFolderPath\" ' Change this to your desired folder
   ```
   For example: `folderPath = "C:\MyTextFiles\"`

## Alternative version with file creation dialog:

If you prefer to choose the folder each time or want more flexibility, here's an alternative version:

```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim selectedID As String
    Dim filePath As String
    Dim folderPath As String
    Dim fullPath As String
    
    ' Check if only one cell is selected and it's in column with IDs
    If Target.CountLarge > 1 Then Exit Sub
    
    ' Check if the selected cell is in the ID column (assuming column A)
    If Target.Column = 1 And Target.Row >= 1 Then
        selectedID = Target.Value
        
        ' Validate that it's an ID
        If Left(selectedID, 2) = "ID" And IsNumeric(Mid(selectedID, 3)) Then
            ' Let user choose folder
            With Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)
                .Title = "Select folder to save text files"
                .InitialFileName = "C:\"
                If .Show = -1 Then
                    folderPath = .SelectedItems(1) & "\"
                    fullPath = folderPath & selectedID & ".txt"
                    
                    ' Check if file exists
                    If Dir(fullPath) <> "" Then
                        ' File exists - open in Notepad
                        Shell "notepad.exe " & Chr(34) & fullPath & Chr(34), vbNormalFocus
                    Else
                        ' File doesn't exist - create it
                        CreateTextFile fullPath
                        MsgBox "File created: " & fullPath, vbInformation
                    End If
                End If
            End With
        End If
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub CreateTextFile(filePath As String)
    Dim fileNumber As Integer
    fileNumber = FreeFile
    Open filePath For Output As fileNumber
    Close fileNumber
End Sub
```

## Features:

- **Automatic detection**: Only works when you click on cells in the ID column
- **File validation**: Checks if the cell content is a valid ID format
- **File existence check**: Opens existing files, creates new ones
- **Notepad integration**: Opens files directly in Notepad
- **Error handling**: Prevents errors with multiple cell selections

## Notes:

- Make sure the folder path exists before running the code
- The code assumes your IDs are in **Column A** - adjust `If Target.Column = 1` if they're in a different column
- The files will be empty when created - you can modify the `CreateTextFile` subroutine to add default content if needed

Let me know if you need any modifications or have questions about the implementation!
